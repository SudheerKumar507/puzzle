       Given 3 jars of capacites: 8, 5 and 3 litres. Our 8 Litres jar is completely filled. Using these 3 jars split the water to obtain exactly.

       I used all the capacites of the jars. At each capacite, we’ll have certain choices of emptying water from one jar into another. We’ll try each choice, calling our function for each capacite, and if we reach the goal, we stop.

           The program produced a sequence of operations to reach the final configuration to initial configuratio.
